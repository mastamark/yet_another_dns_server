yet_another_dns_server
-----------------------

Stupid simple install of bind9 on top of ubuntu 14.04 for those of us who continue to manage our own dns.

Easily used for master or slave by exporting local volume with config(s) and zone files at runtime.

Example for master:
- /some/place/named.conf.local:/etc/bind/named.conf.local
- /some/place/named.conf.options:/etc/bind/named.conf.options
- /some/place/master_zone_files:/var/cache/bind
